## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `numpy`, `pandas` – data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – preprocessing, classical ML models  
  - `tensorflow` / `keras` – deep learning (CNNs)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Collected and preprocessed organ image dataset  
   - Data augmentation (rotation, scaling, flipping) for generalization  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** models  
   - Also tested classical ML classifiers (SVM, Random Forest) on extracted features  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Train/test split for validation  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall  
   - Achieved **~70% accuracy** in classifying organ images
